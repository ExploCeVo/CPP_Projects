Idea   ----   Start
Figure out a list of options the user is interested in doing.
 Things could be:
	Cost effectivesy 
	merchant profit
	analysis on previous investments
	
	these should be more than just numberes, accounts that tie to a bunch of listened numbers with a 
	history. daily change, etc.

buy something? how much for

sell something? how much for

eventually look into deals
