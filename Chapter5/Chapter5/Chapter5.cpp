Code examples and notes from chapter 5 of Programming Practices and Principles.

CHAPTER 5 - ERRORS
====================================================================================
Common types of errors
====================================================================================
		Type								Definition
Poor Specification		Not specific about what a program should do. Cover cases.
Incomplete Program		Not all cases have been taken care of yet.
Unexpected Args			Occurs when a function is given an argument it doesn't use.
Unexpected Input		Typically when reading input from outer sources.
Unexpected State		Various needed data is incorrect for program to run.
Logical Error			Code that is just wrong.
====================================================================================

EXCEPTIONS
If a function finds an error that it cannot handle it does not return normally.
Instead, it throws an exception indicating something went wrong. 
Use this using the "throws" syntax.

DEBUGGING
1. Get program to compile.
2. Get the program to link.
3. Get the program to do what it is supposed to do.
4. Do this millions of times til you get it right.
5. ???
6. Neck.
7. There is never the last bug.

Legit nothing worth coding in this chapter.
